Information:

```

","The selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 23.2 percent from 2022 to 2023.","To find the percentage increase in selling, general and administrative expenses from 2022 to 2023, we need to first calculate the difference in expenses between the two years.

Difference in expenses = 2023 expenses - 2022 expenses
= $3,397,218 - $2,757,447
= $639,771

To find the percentage increase, we'll divide the difference by the 2022 expense and multiply by 100:

Percentage increase = (Difference / 2022 expense) * 100
= ($639,771 / $2,757,447) * 100
= 23","To find the percentage increase in selling, general and administrative expenses from 2022 to 2023, you need to first calculate the difference between the 2023 and 2022 amounts.

$3,397,218 - $2,757,447 = $650,771

Then, divide the difference by the 2022 amount and multiply by 100:

($650,771 / $2,757,447) * 100 = 23.2%

So, the percentage increase in selling, general and administrative expenses from 2022 to 2023 is 23.2%."

1. **Increased drug costs**: By lowering discounts or rebates, insurers may reduce the amount of money they pay to manufacturers for each prescription filled, which can lead to higher drug costs for patients.
2. **Reduced access to affordable medications**: If manufacturers lower their prices due to concessions, it may become more challenging for patients to access affordable medications, as the reduced discount amounts may not be enough to cover the cost of the medication.

1. **Increased prices**: By disclosing negotiated prices, insurers and PBM may be incentivized to lower their prices, leading to higher drug costs for patients.
2. **Reduced ability to negotiate prices**: If insurers or PBM lower their prices, manufacturers may be less likely to negotiate prices with the manufacturer, reducing the manufacturer's ability to offer competitive products and services to consumers.
